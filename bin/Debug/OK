<!-- start of lyrics -->
If you were still around<br />
You'd tell me I'm different<br />
Since the last time you called me out<br />
I'd put you down<br />
I'd tell you it's a waste of time<br />
To keep you by my side<br />
<br />
If you were still around<br />
I swear<br />
We would sit and stare<br />
We would be nowhere<br />
<br />
And to this day<br />
I look for what it's gonna take<br />
To just let things be<br />
Still today, I wonder is it<br />
You or me who should feel guilty?<br />
I'm pulling <br />
I'm pushing <br />
I'm putting it<br />
Out of my mind<br />
Thought that I had said<br />
Goodbye<br />
<br />
If you were still around<br />
You would tell me that you're sorry<br />
But you don't know what you're sorry about<br />
I'd keep to myself<br />
Keep you guessing<br />
Make you question if it's ever gonna work itself out<br />
<br />
If you were still around<br />
I swear<br />
We would sit and stare<br />
We would be nowhere<br />
<br />
And to this day<br />
I look for what it's gonna take<br />
To just let things be<br />
Still today, I wonder is it<br />
You or me who should feel guilty?<br />
I'm pulling <br />
I'm pushing <br />
I'm putting it<br />
Out of my mind<br />
Thought that I had said<br />
Goodbye<br />
<br />
It still haunts me<br />
Yeah, it still haunts me<br />
Yeah, it still haunts me<br />
<br />
And to this day<br />
I look for what it's gonna take<br />
To just let things be<br />
And to this day, I wonder is it<br />
You or me who should feel guilty?<br />
I'm pulling <br />
I'm pushing <br />
I'm putting it<br />
Out of my mind, yeah,<br />
Thought that I had said<br />
Goodbye
